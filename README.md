# kindergarten-coop.
An android app created as a project for the course "Design and implementation of Android applications".
Created by Omri Asakly and Ahmad Khateeb.

The purpose of the app is to make it easier for parents with kids in kindergarten to manage their time.
By creating a weekly schedule, parents pick up a group of kids and drive each one to their house.
The schedule is made so that a parent doesn't have to drive twice, daily, to pick up their kids, instead they have to do it once or twice a week.
